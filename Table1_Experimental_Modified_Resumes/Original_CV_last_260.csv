For the last 2 years I have been working as a marketologist and a content manager on freelance and as a contractor in a marketing agency. My experience in marketing includes social media accounts promotion, project management, customer engagement, marketing strategy development, targeted advertising, lead generation and copywriting and graphic design.

My marketing projects involved working with over 17 industries, including: medicine, beauty, dietetics, charity, fitness, leisure, educational sales.

I have good organizational and process optimization skills. For example, I managed 8 projects simultaneously because I was able to allocate time and set tasks for subordinates.

The managers at the marketing agency where I worked noted strengths of mine such as proactivity, desire for self-improvement. They also mention that I’m a good team player.

During my work as a project manager, I was involved in customer engagement and lead generation. I involved various methods such as newsletter advertising and social media. Additionally, my main task was to guide the client from the first call to the successful end of the project. I built timelines, organized and supervised the work of the team, and organized offline events.

For the last 5 and half years I have been a part of Aviation Company ""Ukrainian Helicopters"" in a role of aviation project manager. Our domain is helicopter transport services for purposes of United Nation peacekeeping operations on African continent. 
My main responsibilities consist of aviation project set up activities and overall project supervision. More detailed information on my responsibilities could be found in my CV. 

As a project manager I was responsible for setting up operational bases in countries like South Sudan, Somalia, DRC and Republic of Mali. 

My biggest achievement would be a successful set up and oversight of operation bases in Republic of Mali that consisted of almost 70 people and 5 highly advanced helicopters. 

In September 2020 I have obtained my professional certification as a Certified Associate Project Manager (CAPM) from Project Management Institute. 

My main motivation behind the transition to IT is the desire to become a part of ever-growing community of awesome professionals who are creating new products and services and adding value to clients. 

I understand that it might be challenging to get a start in IT for me with almost no experience, however, I am confident that my profound knowledge of english, organizational and communication skills as well as ability to multi-function in volatile environments will be a great asset to potential employers. I am also not easily scared by the necessity to ""go an extra mile"" for the team and project. In line of my current work I have developed a positive ""yes-can-do"" attitude towards to any given tasks.
Currently I am looking for an entry level position or even internship for position of Project Management/BA. I am open to new fields of knowledge, experience and new challenges."
291,"As a manager of 4MEN. Barbershop, I was given the following tasks: to recruit a team of potential professionals, improve their hard and soft skills, organize feedback between the barbershop and clients, and establish effective communication among the team members. We managed to attain our objectives. The client flow was increased by more than 50%, and the return rate was at least 87%.

Regarding my leadership of the state project ""The scheme of sanitary cleaning of the villages Horenka and Moshchun"". Our team successfully completed this project in a completely new direction for us promptly. The implementation of our project was supposed to start in 2022-2023. But unfortunately, due to the Russian-Ukrainian war, these settlements have received significant damage and require repairs before the project implementation.
For the last five years, I have managed to apply my knowledge and experience in various fields.

My primary occupation was in the beauty and health sphere, namely the manager and chief barber position in the barbershop 4MEN. As a manager, I was able to recruit a team, set up a workflow, a continuing staff training, and communication among the team members.

I was also a line producer in the production companies Bosonfilm and Happy Hippie Lab. There are several advertising campaigns for international brands among the implemented projects. My role in these projects was to develop the projects and coordinate all stages of their production.

I was the head of the project ""The scheme of sanitary cleaning of the villages Horenka and Moshchun"" in the company LLC ECO CONSULT. Our team created the scheme and plan for the sanitation of settlements. I participated in the scheme creation, planned and coordinated the team activity, negotiated, submitted reports, and presented the project.

In addition to my main job, I undertook various projects, advising business owners on attracting investments, creating business models in beauty and health, target audience search and market analysis, and developing digital marketing strategies and media plans.

In my professional activity, I plan to develop as a part of an IT team to make people's lives better and more comfortable. My goal is to improve my skills in people management, planning, and coordination of various processes.

I have experience and understanding of the basic principles of creating applications/prototypes and developing code, experience in working with various programming languages/frameworks, and a perception of the peculiarities of working with them. Among them, there are Ruby, Java, Haskell, and Scala.
I prefer to work in a team where my following skills will be rewarding: communication skills, integrated approach to problem-solving, ability to organize complex processes, and understanding of behavioral people’s characteristics.

For the past 5 years, I’ve held 3 positions in 2 different companies. I worked a lot with the documents, agreements, and estimates. I’m really into all that ‚paper work‘ and, from my perspective, well-done documentation is one of the components of a successful company/project, still not the most important.

The most valuable skill that I obtained while working as Senior Sales COORDINATION MANAGER -> Coordinator is being a TEAM PLAYER. Our Sales Department consists of people with different approaches and characters, and we’ve managed to maintain effective communication and coordination in various situations, the critical ones as well.

Working closely with Sales managers helped me absorb some of their knowledge and become attached to the cases and clients directly. 

It’s been around 3 years already since I dived into a brand new sphere. It was a road full of constant learning and professional growth. I consider this experience to be interesting and successful. That’s why my feelings about starting a career in a new sphere are rather curious than fearful.

At my current position, I together with my Manager introduce and implement updates in the Sales Department, launch new processes, and help the team to use them effectively. There was the point when I realized that I admire being involved in new projects, improving processes, and working in close cooperation with each team member. One of the tasks was to ensure a smooth record migration of 20 sales reps (who are not typical office workers and spend most of their time outbound) to our internal CRM system. Proud of making it happen.
I look forward to joining the team of enthusiastic people driven by the passion to explore, develop and grow. The opportunities for career advancement, well-established teamwork. I would love to get hands-on training and be mentored by the senior managers"

303,"
Greetings to everyone! 
I’m a Project Manager, who is really into it and I’m highly-motivated to improve my skills, flowing into all Project processes.
I’ve graduated PM courses in a great computer school ”Hillel”. So, I have an idea about:
…what is a project plan
…methodologies and frameworks 
…how to work with risks and how to decrease them
…how to communicate with team and keep them motivated
…how to manage budget, resources and etc.
The main thing I like about being PM is that you communicate with people and help everyone, starting from the customer, to achieve their goals.
Also I’m quite good at solving problems, prefer smiling to getting nervous. Everyone needs challenges to become more self-confident, efficient and strong, and I’m not an exception.
I’m highly interested in jobs with creative, interesting teams, who really love their job and are creating something innovative and incredible.
I’m quite good at studying, now I’m restoring my English(it’s between Intermediate and Upper-Intermediate now) and want to achieve Advanced level in a couple of years.
I absolutely hate wasting time, so when I have leisure time, I try to spend it profitably. For instance, communicating with interesting people, reading books, doing some kind of sport, watching Ted and so on.
Thanks for attention!
I will be extremely glad to meet new people!

Hi,
I have managerial experience in the German-Ukrainian automotive company with over 3000 employees.
I started my career as a technologist and was responsible for adjusting processes according to customer requirements and documentation for the Audi A4 and Audi Q3 projects and was promoted to the deputy head of the department.
After the company's expansion (4 enterprises in Ukraine), I had an excellent opportunity to try myself as the head of the change management department. This role included the Project Coordinator responsibilities. I was responsible for the Audi Q3 (new generation AU326) and Skoda Octavia projects. Considering that my Team and I should implement these projects from the kick-off, my responsibilities as a Project Coordinator included communication with stakeholders: clients, developers, logistics, procurement, and project management dept. (from the German side) and internal communication with plant managers in Ukraine.
 Also significant was the calculation of each change (cost of the product) sent by the developers and communication with the sales department to assess this change, followed by implementation in production.
In our company, we used the Scrum and Kanban methods and launched Lean management in production. I had extensive experience in daily, weekly stakeholder meetings (client (Lear, Faurecia), project managers (Germany), procurement and logistics department (Poland)). All communication took place exclusively in English (Zoom, Teams, Outlook). I've completed the SPE School Leadership Effectiveness and Team Management Skills courses. There I learned the stages of team development (Forming, Storming, Norming, and Performing) and successfully put this methodology into practice.
The following step in my career was the opportunity to join the production team as Deputy Production Director and actively participate in all optimizations process.
After that I held the position of the head of the Labor Protection Department and Ecology in all Ukrainian representation departments. Successfully passed external audits from TUV (ISO 14001, ISO 45001, and Fire Safety at the enterprise). I developed my Team and methods for tracking and verifying deadlines. I communicated closely with the relevant state structures and authorities.
I've been working as a project coordinator for a long time, and I am eager to develop in this direction and try myself in the IT field to grow and improve my skills with exciting projects and people.

Hi, there!

Are you looking for me?

Let me tell a little about me :)

Communication skills are my natural ones.
I worked as the Engagement Manager in software company, as a Supply Manager I sold conference service.  Worked a lot with clients database and Excel. Have experience in B2B and B2C sales (IT, tenants, goods).
 
- Excel
- MS Word
- SQL (basic)

My accuracy and English knowledge were efficiently used in translating of business correspondence with partners and tenants (English - Russian and vice versa). Sometimes I assisted in the negotiation process as an interpreter (business meetings, calls) or translator (e-mails, deeds).

Researched and updated all required materials needed to the firm and partners. Got some SMM experience created pages and updated information on the companies.

As a sociable person I like communication and organization of events or parties.

If you'd like to know more, I'll be glad to meet you.

Have a good day!
Friendly team, interesting projects"
337,"Besides having experience in team-level operational management, I have majorly contributed to defining overall company strategy, and efficient collaboration between departments and that business objectives are met:

- I developed business processes for automating the work of the team and reporting templates, which helped to reduce wasted time by 20% and increase throughput;
- Introduced the concept of working with risks and instructions for managing complex integration projects;
- I personally conducted about 100 projects from $50,000 to $500,000.
Hi there!

In 4 years of work in IT integration, I gained a lot of experience and became the strongest specialist in the team.

I worked with a large number of projects of world-famous companies, had experience managing a team of 5-9 people, was a mentor, a project manager and overcame impostor syndrome (:D).

My superpower is the ability to find a solution in the most complicated and challenging environment and bring new (and even bold) initiatives to life. I learn things from 0 to pro-level in a flick and always look for ways how to improve processes around me - and help my team perform better.

Being PM for me - is:
1) to be a Leader, Facilitator, Coach, and Member at the same time because the success of any project, and the true engine of its work, is its team. That’s why I think that bringing together the right people and being able to manage them is extremely important.
2) to be a reliable partner to the client, because my mission is to make their businesses prosper with the tech I sell, avoiding being slippery and stuffy. 
I love getting 'thank you!' LinkedIn messages from clients and team members I've worked with even a couple of years ago, I'm looking for a team who shares this vision.

So I'd love to share a copy of my CV - so do not hesitate to reach me back :)

Let's talk?
Personality respect and cooperative culture play big roles for me. I am looking for a company that moves forward with inspiration and courage."

I am a motivated professional with a diverse background in HR management and a growing passion for development and project management. Throughout my experience as an HR Manager in an IT company, I discovered a keen interest in both the technical aspects of development and the coordination of projects.

My journey into the world of development began with front-end courses. I honed my skills in various programming languages, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js. Through this experience, I gained proficiency in popular frameworks and tools such as Bootstrap, Tailwind, and Git. Additionally, I learned how to work with APIs.

Building upon my front-end development skills, I embarked on a volunteer project with Chingu. Over a span of six weeks, I collaborated with a team of four developers to create an e-commerce website using React.js and Tailwind. This project allowed me to apply my knowledge and skills in a real-world setting, reinforcing my passion for development.

However, I realized that I wanted to combine my expertise in HR management with my newfound knowledge of development. This led me to pursue a deep dive into project management. Currently, I am actively studying two project management courses to acquire the necessary skills to bring teams together and excel as a manager.

380,"I used to hitchhike around CIS and Europe with a tight budget and fixed timeline.
I've been working in a product company as a Support Specialist for 1.5 years. 
I've got experience in working and communicating with foreign customers, resolving difficult tasks. 
Most of my time I've spent working with: Jira, Outlook, SQL, Google/Microsoft documents

Last 6 months I've been working as a Junior Project manager in Automat IT company.
It was an amazing experience, and I strive to continue working in IT as a Project Manager.

Here is the list of what I've been working on:

•Developing and managing project plans, control project risks, resources, and time schedules for multiple projects (DevOps infra-related projects) at the same time;
•Working with the customer and the team on RFC definition and LOE;
•Creating weekly reports for the related customers;
•Designing and implementing ticketing system for support solution based on Jira Service Management;
•Creating and managing a series of local events in the office;

___________________________________________________

I'm 25 years old. 

I used to hitchhike a lot and I've got a few main ideas about how it is working. 

First one - you need to have a goal. It could be a city, a place, a girl, a friend, an adventure.

The second one - planning is important, but you should have enough space in your plans to allow circumstances to happen and make your plans even better.

In real life, nothing goes according to plan, and, one of the most important skills that I have in my life is to be flexible and reach your goals no matter what plans are, have been, or will ever be, 

My main goal is to start my own business, an IT company. I don't know yet how it will be, what partner to choose, how to manage such a complex structure, etc. 

But I know for sure that I can gain the necessary expertise, and in process of it, I can make life better for many people and businesses.

381,"I've a masters degree in Project Management with a great distinction. I've completed many projects and thus strongly familiar with Project Life cycle as well as the ten knowledge areas of Project Management.
I've completed many projects with outstanding performance, in where I'm currently working as a project Manager as well as when I was working as a System Administrator. I've involved in many projects in different domains including the area of; software development(many software projects with Agile SDLC using Jira and other tools), Networking(supply, install and configure a Network of international school and others), Social Work(), Military(Weapon Management system), Health, Transportation(Ride hailing service). I'm currently working as a Project Manager Full-time and part-time at two different companies.
I don't want to be involved in Technical works, because I don't want to caught up on the specifics rather I want to put directions so that the project can be completed within budget on time and desired quality."
382,"Purposefulness - despite some things may be new to me, I put all my dedication to learn them deeply.
Sociability -  I like to communicate and it helps to get information or solve the problem.
Continuous learning - no matter how difficult it was, I love to learn new things: learned PowerBI, took courses, learned how to manage a team.
I've entered my previous job as risk manager in a fintech startup. I had been working a lot with Excel, PowerBI and some internal tools. One of my responsibilities was communication with other teams (including in order to provide colleagues from other departments with relevant information). I was also responsible for the whole platform performance and adding new tools successfully. I documented all the procedures and features in Confluence. About a year ago, we started working on a new project (crypto app). I started to onboard new team members (5+ people) and was responsible for their performance (gave tasks, checked the results, set priorities - using Jira). I also took part in the entire product development, including design, cooperation with developers (tasks creation and prioritization, testing, verifying QA results), describing new features flow, key metrics creation (business metrics, fraud metrics), cash flow and security management. Furthermore, I also conduct researches, including ones that analyze our competitors. Now I mostly perform team lead role managing our team (creating shifts schedule, defining bonus amounts, creating tasks and their prioritization, estimation, holding weekly planing and daily meetings). 
Since I had a chance to perform project-manager-like and team lead duties, I understood that it is exactly the direction in which I want to develop myself, so I started to take project management courses.
Hope to find an interesting project where I can develop my skills, be helpful and benefit the team. It would be great to have an option of remote work and transparent growth and development options."

435,"As a result of my educational course, I acquired
an understanding of software development methodologies. I also learnt about a variety of plans and registers that are of paramount importance in project management. As well, I became quite familiar with Scrum and Kanban frameworks. I constantly worked with Jira, tracking the progress, and writing user stories with acceptance criteria. In addition, I gained experience working with the Miro app, creating plenty of boards, and the GanttPro, planning and coordinating the projects. But my biggest accomplishment was establishing a friendly environment and trust with each member of my team. There, I had the opportunity to demonstrate my problem-solving, critical thinking, and leadership skills, achieving great results.
My educational project was called ‘Mandruy’, which meant ‘travel’ in Ukrainian. It was devoted to the development of an app that could be a potential competitor to ‘Tripadvisor’, having the same functionality, but dedicated exclusively to Ukraine and its places of interest.      
    For our project, my team and I implemented an Agile methodology, since the project could have been quite large and unpredictable. Along the way, we produced Lean Canvas and Mind Map as well as Outline and prototypes. To monitor the progress of the project, we chose the Kanban board within Jira Software.

437,"I solved countless of problems between the companies I worked at and their clients, negotiation is one of my strong sides.
My entire life I was always goal-oriented. Everywhere I go, I set myself one mission - to improve ongoing business processes as well as challenge myself and enhance my skills.

I started my career working in sales when I was 12 and have not stopped since. By now I have accumulated 12 years of experience in Sales (B2C and B2B) of which, 3 were spent working in Business Development.  

Being constantly in contact with Project Managers and Product owners, I realised that leading projects while motivating people on the team and supporting them is something that I want to do in the future. 

While being a Business Developer I got involved in different projects helping PMs in the companies I worked at. During  that period I decided to enhance my knowledge in that direction. 

The more challenges I face, the more excited I feel for
the working process.

You can see the recent PM courses I took in the ""Courses"" part of my Resume.

My experience may be of your interests.  For the whole carrier I was a PM in construction, but because of the war in Ukraine decided to switch to Project Management in IT. For the recent period I passed online courses at Udemy and got familiar with software, which is usually required in IT development, i.e. Jira, Confluence, Slack. Have fundamental understanding of Agile methodology (Scrum, Kanban) and Waterfall. Have lack of technical knowledge, but am sure that working on your projects will be able to get basics in IT products development in very short time. 

Working in PM environment allowed me to gain soft skills like project administration (reporting, progress analyses, scheduling, budget follow up, hiring the staff), business communication with clients and within the team, excellent time management and work prioritising skills. Have strong responsibility sense and readiness to take ownership of the required tasks, which is proved by number of completed projects and minimum job changes during the carrier. 

Because of Russia invasion in Ukraine I became a refugee and now have time to dedicate it for projects. Would be pleased to show how I can be useful as Junior PM or Scrum Master in the online interview.

440,"As my biggest accomplishments, I consider the fact that war didn't make me to give up, it only improved my stress resistance. I kept on growing as a person and devoted a large part of my live to helping people. Besides the fact I moved on to England by my own to study and work in two places at a time each, I volunteered with local Ukranians, who also was forced to leave their homes. And not only my schedule became tight, I did my best to perform my rolls in the good way. I learnt basic marketing in one semester and passed exam in my English college; became a shift leader in a month at work; gained a number of loyal students, who finally could communicare with natives after our lessons and finished my university semester with one extra science work done. Nothing of that could be completed without a good time management.
My experience was mostly related to volunteer work because I used to participate in many such projects. The last one turned out to be the most exciting and challenging for me. Because of the war, in Lviv was a huge demand for shelters for internally displaced persons. I found the place that needed people and submitted an offer. As soon as I started, I took the role of shift leader, It was a responsible position and I knew I could perform it well. The place was chaotic because it was new and all of the processes were still stabilizing. Our team decided to focus our attention on the ones, that could make the biggest impact. In the end, we developed a resource accounting system, implemented a consistent schedule, and reorganized storage. I was also responsible for communication with higher management. This led to improving the speed of daily processes and made an impact on the future of the community. That is where we made a difference.

462,"I wrote website code for a business, completed an internship at the IT company InternetDevels.  I have valuable communication experience, I worked as a host of English-language shows for foreigners in Bulgaria.
One of my latest projects was writing code for a business website (I built a website for selling cars; I used Python).  I also had experience in copywriting, project planning, time management and negotiations.  I got this knowledge at the university, I am studying Applied Linguist (third year).  I also have practice writing posts and creating content for social networks, for this I used the Canva program.  Moreover, the three vacancies I worked on were related to communication with people.  I managed to cope well with responsibilities, but I realized that Applied linguistics is for me and I want to develop and work in IT.
I understand that I definitely do not want to do coding, because now you can only do it at a primitive level. Besides, It is easy for me to find an approach to people and create a good atmosphere during communication, I know how to allocate time and plan work according to deadlines.  That is, I understand technologies, but I consider organizational skills to be my strong point. Therefore, I am looking for such vacancies as IT recruiter, HR manager, Sales manager, Account manager and Project Manager."

Working more than 5 years in Autotransport Company in the US, based out of Florida. With a local office in Dnipro. Each transportation request for my clients is a separate project for me. From Start to Finish. I have to meet both, the client's and driver's needs for each order (deadlines, price, contract terms, specifics of the service). That makes my job similar to the job of a Project Manager. With the only difference in the final product/service that is provided.

In my daily activities, I'm using CRM, Trello, DocuSign. Used to work with Confluence and Jira too.

I wish to change my current field and find myself growing in the IT sector. As the first step in this journey, I completed PM courses at Hillel IT School with an excellent score.
I like to complete all the tasks, provide good service, and meet deadlines. I'm a quick learner and do not hesitate to take responsibility."
