390,"During the pandemic, I assisted in organizing volunteer events to maintain sanitary standards in Kharkiv.

At KHNURE, I was responsible for managing all paperwork for my group and faculty events. When a few students in my group lost documents that could not be urgently reissued, I took initiative to resolve the issue by negotiating with another group to obtain their unused stock of documents.

I have experience working as an administrator at a beauty salon, where I occasionally took on managerial duties and utilized the Salesforce CRM system. I identified opportunities to enhance employee competence and provided refresher courses for interested staff members. Additionally, I proposed ideas for promoting the company online.

I participated in the QA Automation Tester company's learning program, where I gained experience with Pycharm, Pytest, and Selenium.

Currently, I am developing a Ukrainian law offices landing site and am eager to expand my skills in project management, driven by my interest in processes and people."
